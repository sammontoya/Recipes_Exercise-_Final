<h1>Recipes Exercise</h1>

Let's make a site for sharing recipes.

~As an internet user, I can go to the website and get a compelling experience of what the website is all about. " Timebox: 1 hour!

~As a cook, I want to post new recipes, so that I can share them with others.

~As a cook, I want to tag my recipes, so that they are easier to find. (Hint: a recipe has many tags. Another hint: don't be afraid to create several actions for this: one page for creating tags, one page for creating recipes, one page for adding tags to a recipe.)

~As a cook, I want to choose a tag and see what recipes have that tag.

~As a cook, I want to give a recipe 1 through 5 stars, so that I can share with others what I think of a recipe. To make things easier this can be a dropdown menu 1-5

~As a cook, I want to see recipes ordered by the number of stars they have, so that I can focus on the best ones.

~As a cook, I want to see some new recipes mixed in with the highest-rated ones, so that I can give new recipes with no or few ratings a try. (Hint: make a method that creates an arbitrary weighting between the average number of stars a recipe has, and how old it is.)

~As a cook, I want to search through recipes, so that I can find something with a particular ingredient or word. (Hint: use sql like)
